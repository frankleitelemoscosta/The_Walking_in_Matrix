<h2>INTRODUTION</h2>

This project was proposed by teacher of the discipline of Data Struct and Algorithms the
Mr Pires. The goal this project is so the student remember definitions and concepts about
matrix and learn the use metode of matrix walking of greedy way. You see in the code and 
test cases my programming logic, I use the C programming lenguage for developed
because this lenguage was proposed by Mr Pires.

<h2>IMPLEMETATION DECISIONS</h2>

The first decision was add the files for create matrix and insert this matrix in the text files
of the project, I init the implemetation this way because I donÂ´t have skip this party then the 
first thing that program need is the matrix and your elements.In this moment I was added by me
three files that consversation between then, this means structs, functions and variables

<h2>THE TEST CASES AND YOUR RESULTS</h2>

<h3>THE FIRST TEST CASE</h3>

In this case implemated three files,
